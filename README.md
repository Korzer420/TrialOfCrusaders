# Trial of Crusaders
A Hollow Knight mod that adds a rogue-like mode. (Inspired by Dead Cells, Binding of Isaac and Blue Prince)

Conquer the trials by killing all enemies in the room to continue. Pick up powers and stats to bolster your might.
You'll need that, as enemies will also scale over course of the trial.

This mod uses a special game mode that has to be selected while creating a new save file.

**Note that this mod is not intended to work in any way with other game altering mods (like Pale Court). Any conflicts that might occur due to this will be discarded as "Not an actual problem"!**

Once you start the game mode you'll find yourself in the colosseum. 
In the hole to the right you'll enter the archive where you can see past runs as well as some tablets that you may unlock... somehow.

## Trial Gameplay
If you selected a trial and entered the "colosseum" you'll be moved to the Markoth room with a tablet which explains the rules for the run as well as 9 tablets which serve as your seed. 
You can hit these to change to use your own seed, but will noticed that the tablets turn red. This indicates that the selected sign is different from the one originally chosen for you.
This has no greater effect than marking the history entry of your run as "seeded".

If you exit through the left, the real run begins.

Shinies are very important, at least all that are not placed like in the original game (these will turn into 50 geo instead). These are abilities and/or stats. 
There are three stats:
- Combat: Increases your nail damage.
- Spirit: Increases your maximum soul and the soul gained from hit enemies.
- Endurance: Heals you for 1 and increases your maximum health.

Besides the main function of stats each of those may be used for some abilities to improve them. Abilities which scale with stats are marked by (C), (S) and/or (E) in the name.

Other shinies hold abilities/powers which improve your character. You may only choose one between the three options, but you can always forfeit a selection if you don't like any.
Sometimes abilities even grant bonus stats (shown at the bottom of an ability panel).

The following shinies exist:
- "Tri Color" shiny: Gives you the choice between one point in combat, spirit or endurance.
- Red shiny: +1 in Combat.
- Purple shiny: +1 in Spirit.
- Green shiny: +1 in Endurance.
- White shiny: Gives you a choice between your two lowest stats. These "catchup" shinies appear more frequently if one stat is much higher than the other two.
- White shiny (with extra glow): Shows a selection of 3 different abilities to choose from.
- Rainbow shiny (with glow): Shows you a selection of three rare abilities. Abilities are given a rarity (either common, uncommon or rare).
- Golden shiny (with glow): Gives you a movement ability, vengeful spirit or desolate dive. These are unskippable as the mod determines from these benchmarks which rooms will be available afterwards.
- ???

The mod will generate all rooms in advance and grant access to more rooms the more movement abilities you have. **The mod should only let you in a room, if it is sure you can reach and kill all enemies**.
The movement abilities are granted pseudo randomly somewhere in the run.

**If you die, succeed or leave the trial (through the menu) the run will end and all powers, stats and movement abilities are revoked.**

Known Quirks:
- Lifeblood is placed weirdly -> Intentional (once you hit the endurance cap, you'll understand why).
- The room opened even though not all enemies are dead -> The mod broadly counts enemies present at the start of the room (excluding some). There is no 100% consistency in between rooms.
- The cursor in the power selection is sometimes messed up -> Yeah... apparently... odd... right? (This is intentional)
- I have dream nail although I didn't pick that power -> Some rooms grant you dream nail as certain enemies (mostly the crystal crawlers (?)) are immune to nail damage. So this is implemented to prevent softlocks, although the mod should notify you, if it is enabled.

**This list may be expanded upon in the future. If you encounter something that you may classify as a bug, look here first.**

## Placeholder Sprites?
You might've seen the few... dozens placeholder sprites for powers. As I don't have any artistic skills, I can't provide good images. But if YOU want to donate a sprite for an ability, I'd gladly implement it and credit you (obviously).
Keep in mind, that I'm not capable of paying you for your service, but I'd deeply appreciate any help in that department <3
